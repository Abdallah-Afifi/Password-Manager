# Password-Manager

# Development Flow for the Password Manager

1.	Define the Password Manager Data Structure: This is the foundation of the program and should be designed with security in mind.
2.	Implement Cryptography: Encryption and decryption functions should be implemented to ensure that all stored passwords are secure. Biometric authentication can also be integrated at this stage.
3.	Add User Input and Output Functions: Functions should be added to allow users to interact with the program and to display output to users.
4.	Implement Password Generation Function: A password generation function should be added to allow users to create strong, random passwords.
5.	Implement Error Handling Functions: Functions should be added to handle errors, such as incorrect input, file reading/writing errors, and authentication failures.
6.	Implement Automatic Password Change Function: A function should be added to allow users to schedule automatic password changes.
7.	Add Customization Options: Settings should be added to allow users to customize password length, complexity requirements, and other preferences.
8.	Implement File Handling: Functions should be added to read and write encrypted credentials to a file.
9.	Implement Search and Retrieve Function: A function should be added to allow users to search for and retrieve stored passwords.
10.	Add Two-Factor Authentication: Two-factor authentication should be implemented to enhance the security of the program.
11.	Add Integration with Other Security Tools: Functions should be added to allow the program to communicate with other security tools, such as anti-virus software or firewalls.
12.	Add Limited Sharing Options: A sharing function should be added to allow users to share passwords securely with multiple users.
